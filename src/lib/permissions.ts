//   - technician: report incidents, view board, do PM tasks, view machines

//   - manager:    + manage equipment master (machines/areas/factories),
//                   PM schedules, edit settings (but NOT user accounts)
//   - director:   factory-level oversight (dashboard + incident actions)
//   - admin:      everything, including user & password management
